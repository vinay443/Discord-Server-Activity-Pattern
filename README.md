# Data Visualization - Fall 2024 - Final Project (valochat)

Our project, Discord Server Activity Pattern, we will analyze the trends and the behaviour of the user from the community of Official Valorant Discord Server, with the chat data we are going to extract with the tool Discord Chat Exporter. The data will range from March of 2020 to April of 2021, totalling one complete year, which will give us enough information to explore user activity, patterns and sentiments on the chat. We will apply Time Series analysis of the data to understand the trend over time and Sentiment Analysis will try to understand the overall mood of the users in the chat. This is not all but these are the important ones we are about to perform. The insights we are going to gain will help assist game developers in understanding how their user base, who utilize discord which most of them do, react based on the various updates and patch notes added to the game. This will help the community and the developers to have a better bond understanding how the community grows.
